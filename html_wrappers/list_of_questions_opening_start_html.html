  <h3>Note for users of screen readers:</h3>
  This page has been tested for screen reader support with the following Operating Systems and web browsers:
  <ul>
    <li>Mac OSX 10.12.4 Sierra: Voiceover:
  <ul>
    <li>The Safari browser is fully supported: The browser allows navigating the page with the normal "VO + arrow keys" keyboard shortcuts, and will read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
    <li>The Google Chrome browser is partially supported: The browser seems not to be compatible with using the "VO + arrow keys" keyboard shortcuts to navigate page elements, but is compatible with jumping between headings, et cetera, and will read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
    <li>The Mozilla Firefox browser is partially supported: The browser will read headings, et cetera, but will not read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Windows 10:
  <ul>
    <li>JAWS (using version 18.0.4104)
  <ul>
    <li>The Google Chrome browser is fully supported: The browser allows navigating the page with the normal "arrow keys" and "enter" keyboard shortcuts, and will read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.
  When reading changes in the text, JAWS will start reading each change by saying the word "removed." This is a result of how JAWS notices that the text is changed; the text is actually still there, and is highlighted.</li>
    <li>The Mozilla Firefox browser is fully supported: The browser allows navigating the page with the normal "arrow keys" and "enter" keyboard shortcuts, and will read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.
  When reading changes in the text, JAWS will start reading each change by saying the word "removed." This is a result of how JAWS notices that the text is changed; the text is actually still there, and is highlighted.</li>
    <li>The Microsoft Edge browser is not supported: The browser does not seem to use the same keyboard shortcuts, and thus does not seem to read headings, et cetera, or to read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>NVDA (using version 2017.2)
  <ul>
    <li>The Google Chrome browser is partially supported: The browser will read headings, et cetera, but will not read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
    <li>The Mozilla Firefox browser is partially supported: The browser will read headings, et cetera, but will not read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
    <li>The Microsoft Edge browser is partially supported: The browser will read headings, et cetera, but will not read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Linux (using Kubuntu version 17.04): Orca (using version 3.22.2):
  <ul>
    <li>The Google Chrome browser is not supported. The browser does not seem to interact with Orca, and thus does not seem to read headings, et cetera, or to read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked.</li>
    <li>The Mozilla Firefox browser is almost fully supported: The browser allows navigating the page with the normal "arrow keys," "tab key," and "enter" keyboard shortcuts, and will read changes in the text when an Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked. However, when a Frequently Asked Questions list item is clicked, it will sometimes read changes in the text out of order (for example, it will sometimes read sections that are lower down on the page before reading sections that are further up).</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  We are still working on supporting other browsers and screen reader software consistently for this page. If you are a screen-reader user and would like to provide feedback to us, please contact us through our <a title="Link to Library feedback form" href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/forms/libhomepage-feedback.html">feedback form</a>.
  <!-- Note: Eventually, we will switch to https://faq.library.upenn.edu/friendly.php?slug=ask. This older form is the one that was most recently checked for accessibility compatibility, and so is what is currently being used here. -->

  <!-- Note for testing: Keyboard shortcuts for VoiceOver: ("VO" means Control + Option on a Mac keyboard) - For Chrome: - Find (and cycle through) bullet list items: VO + Cmd + l - Find (and cycle through) bullet list items (reverse): VO + Cmd + Shift + l - Click link: VO + Space - For Firefox and Safari: - Cycle through page elements: VO + right/left arrow - Click link: VO + Space -->
