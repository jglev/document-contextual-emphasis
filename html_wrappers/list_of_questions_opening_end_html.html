    <h4>Notes for users of screen readers:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Below, only if javascript is turned on, there is a search box, followed by a bullet-list of questions. When you type in the search box, the list will hide items that do not match your search term.</li>
      <li>Below the list of questions is the full text of our Privacy Policy. When you click on a question, the text of the Privacy Policy fades out except for the portions that are relevant to that question. Therefore, when you click on a question, just those relevant portions of the Privacy Policy, which have not faded away, will be read to you.</li>
      <li>At the very bottom of the list is a link to reset the full text to be its normal color. This link just makes the text appear as it did when the page was first loaded; because it is not highlighting any specific portions of text, clicking on that link will not trigger any portion to be automatically read.</li>
    </ul>
