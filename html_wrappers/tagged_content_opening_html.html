<div id="faq-searchable-content" aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="removals" aria-atomic="false"> <!-- Tell screen readers to be polite (i.e., not to interrupt themselves) when reading dynamic text, and to read specifically additions or changes to text content when they change. This will be relevant below, because when text visually becomes highlighted, jQuery will replace it with a copy of itself, hopefully triggering the screen reader to see it as an addition or text change to the DOM. -->
