This document is detailed. It's written in language that we hope is easy to understand (no "legalese"); because of its length, though, we know that it could look intimidating.

Therefore, while you're welcome to read the entire document below, we've included a list of questions that we think you might have. Clicking on a question will highlight the relevant parts of the Privacy Policy for you, making it easier to understand.

If there is a question that you think should be listed here, please let us know!
